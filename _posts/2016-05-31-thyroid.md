                into lumen and encroach on colloid.

        -   Glands treated with radioactive iodine show initially
            nuclear abnormalities, dissolution of some of the follicles,
            and vascular alterations.

***\
Diffuse nontoxic goitre***

-   Impaired synthesis of thyroid hormone causes compensatory increase
    in TSH and resultant hypertrophy/hyperplasia of thyroid follicular
    cells, and ultimately enlargement of entire gland.

-   follicles often filled with colloid ‘colloid goitre’

-   Occurs as endemic and sporadic

    -   Endemic – iodine deficiency

    -   Sporadic – goitrogens (substances interfere with TH synthesis),
        inherited defects in TH synthesis.

-   2 phases

    -   hyperplastic phase – diffusely enlarged gland. Follicles lined
        by crowded columnar cells which may pile up and
        form projections. Accumulation not uniform – some follicles
        hugely distended, others remain small.

    -   phase of colloid involution – if increased dietary iodine
        increases or demand for TH reduces, the stimulated follicular
        epithelium involutes to form an enlarged colloid rich gland
        (colloid goitre).

***Nodular hyperplasia / Multinodular goitre***

-   Repeated cycles of hyperplasia and involution can combine to form an
    irregular multinodular goitre. Virtually all long standing simple
    goitres convert into multinodular goitres.

-   Arise because of variation amongst follicular cells in their
    response to external stimuli (trophic hormones). Cells with a growth
    advantage (eg intrinsic genetic abN similar to those in adenoma) can
    give rise to clones of proliferating cells.

-   may result in a nodule which can become autonomous (toxic
    nodular goitre).

-   Macro: Diffusely but irregularly enlarged gland. Irregular nodules
    containing variable amounts of brown, gelatinous colloid. May have
    areas of haemorrhage, fibrosis, calcification, cystic change.

            flattened, inactive epithelium;

        -   adenomatoid nodules - small hyperplastic follicles.

    -   Nodules lack encapsulation. Lack compression of
        adjacent parenchyma.

    -   Areas of haemorrhage, fibrosis, calcification, histiocytes.

    -   Hurtle cell change common.

    -   Surrounding parenchyma usually also shows microscopically
        nodular architecture.

    -   ***adenomatoid nodule***

        -   highly cellular with microfollicles resembling a follicular
            adenoma / carcinoma

        -   adenomatoid nodule vs follicular adenoma

            -   different profile of follicle size compared with
                surrounding tissue, however still exhibits range of
                follicle size (does not exhibit uniformity of
                follicular adenoma)

            -   lacks circumferential thick capsule. May have
                partial capsule.

            -   lacks compression of adjacent parenchyma

        the entire capsule is embedded. Closest margin.

-   Histological features used to reach diagnosis

    -   In a nodule diagnosed on FNA as a follicular neoplasm, one would
        expect a circumscribed nodule composed solely or predominantly
        of microfollicles

    -   Possible lesions include

        -   Adenomatoid nodule in context of nodular hyperplasia

            -   Circumscribed but not encapsulated

            -   Composed predominantly of microfollicles but shows some
                variation in follicle size

            -   Remaining parenchyma demonstrates a nodular architecture
                with variable follicle size

        -   Follicular adenoma

        -   Follicular carcinoma

            -   Both lesions demonstrate encapsulated nodules composed
                of uniform microfollicles

            -   Follicular carcinomas demonstrates capsular invasion or
                vascular invasion.

            -   Need to assess entire capsule

        -   Follicular variant of papillary carcinoma

                architecture
