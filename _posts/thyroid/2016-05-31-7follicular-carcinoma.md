***Follicular Carcinoma***

-   5-15% of thyroid malignancy

-   Present as non-functioning solitary nodule

-   Macro:

    -   Minimally invasive – single well encapsulated nodule. solid,
        fleshy, and tan to light brown.

    -   Widely invasive – may lack capsule, show infiltration beyond
        main tumour mass.

-   LM:

    -   Closely packed microfollicles. Less commonly, solid,
        trabeculae, macrofollicular.

    -   Carcinoma demonstrates:

        -   Capsular invasion

            -   Classified as:

                -   Minimally invasive

                -   Widely invasive

                    -   Widespread infiltration of thyroid parenchyma

                    -   Often lack complete encapsulation

        -   Vascular invasion

            -   within or outside capsule. Intravascular tumour must be
                covered by endothelium or have attached thrombus

            -   Classified as:

                -   &lt;4 vessels – 5% metastasis rate

                -   &gt;/= 4 vessels – 18% metastasis rate

    -   Lacks papillary-type nuclear features

    -   Variant: ***Hurtle cell carcinoma***

        -   More aggressive behaviour

-   IHC: thyroglobulin, TTF-1, PAX8

-   Genetics:

    -   *PAX8/PPARgamma* rearrangement (50%)

    -   Ras activating point mutations (30-50%)

    -   Inactivating mutations of PTEN and PIK3CA

-   Clinical:

    -   Haematogenous spread more often than lymphatic spread.

    -   Prognosis

        -   Tumour size

        -   minimally vs widely invasive types

        -   metastasis

        -   age

-   Typically metastasise via haematogenous route, most commonly to lung
    and bone.
