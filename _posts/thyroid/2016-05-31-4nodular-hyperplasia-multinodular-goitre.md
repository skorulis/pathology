-   Repeated cycles of hyperplasia and involution can combine to form an
    irregular multinodular goitre. Virtually all long standing simple
    goitres convert into multinodular goitres.

-   Arise because of variation amongst follicular cells in their
    response to external stimuli (trophic hormones). Cells with a growth
    advantage (eg intrinsic genetic abN similar to those in adenoma) can
    give rise to clones of proliferating cells.

-   may result in a nodule which can become autonomous (toxic
    nodular goitre).

-   Macro: Diffusely but irregularly enlarged gland. Irregular nodules
    containing variable amounts of brown, gelatinous colloid. May have
    areas of haemorrhage, fibrosis, calcification, cystic change.

-   LM:

    -   Heterogenous appearance

    -   Vague nodularity at low power

    -   Nodules composed of variably sized follicles

        -   colloid nodules - dilated colloid-rich follicles lined by
            flattened, inactive epithelium;

        -   adenomatoid nodules - small hyperplastic follicles.

    -   Nodules lack encapsulation. Lack compression of
        adjacent parenchyma.

    -   Areas of haemorrhage, fibrosis, calcification, histiocytes.

    -   Hurtle cell change common.

    -   Surrounding parenchyma usually also shows microscopically
        nodular architecture.

    -   ***adenomatoid nodule***

        -   highly cellular with microfollicles resembling a follicular
            adenoma / carcinoma

        -   adenomatoid nodule vs follicular adenoma

            -   different profile of follicle size compared with
                surrounding tissue, however still exhibits range of
                follicle size (does not exhibit uniformity of
                follicular adenoma)

            -   lacks circumferential thick capsule. May have
                partial capsule.

            -   lacks compression of adjacent parenchyma

-   ***Dyshormogenic goitre***

    -   due to inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis

    -   present with congenital hypothyroidism or early-onset goiter.

    -   macro: enlarged, nodular gland. Secondary haemorrhage and
        fibrosis may be present.

    -   LM:

        -   extreme follicular hyperplasia.

        -   Nodules show solid, microfollicular or trabecular patterns.

        -   Minimal colloid

        -   Lined by cells with marked cytologic atypia

        -   Fibrosis throughout

        -   different nodules show different degrees of cellularity and
            architecture

-   ***Amiodarone toxicity***

    -   LM:

        -   Patchy

        -   Follicles lined by flattened or vacuolated epithelium

        -   Interstitial and intrafollicular foamy histiocytes.
