-   ***Acute thyroiditis***

    -   Infection – viral, bacterial, fungal

    -   Present with painful enlargement of thyroid

    -   Macro: focally or diffusely softened with areas of purulence

    -   LM: acute inflammation with microabscesses

<!-- -->

-   ***Subacute granulomatous/ De Quervain thyroiditis***

    -   F:M = 4:1. Age 40-50 yrs.

    -   Postviral syndrome.

    -   Presents with thyroid pain, variable gland enlargement, fever,
        malaise

    -   3 phases: transient hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, recovery.
        Patients recover thyroid function in few months without
        specific treatment.

    -   Macro: Asymmetrically enlarged, nodular, slightly firm thyroid.
        Irregular white-tan lesions may be present.

    -   LM:

        -   early (hyperthyroid phase) – active inflammation with
            scattered follicle disruption, colloid depletion and
            formation of neutrophilic microabscesses.

        -   Later (hypothyroid phase) – aggregates of lymphocytes,
            histiocytes (granulomas), plasma cells form around
            collapsed/damaged follicles (scarce follicular epithelium).
            Histiocytes and multinucleate giant cells enclose naked
            pools or fragments of colloid.

        -   Recovery phase – regeneration of follicles with fibrosis and
            chronic inflammatory cells.

    -   DDx: granulomatous thyroiditis – sarcoidosis, infection (TB,
        fungi), palpation thyroiditis

-   ***Palpation thyroiditis (multifocal granulomatous thyroiditis)***

    -   85-95% of surgically resected glands

    -   Response to minor trauma

    -   LM: multiple isolated or small groups of follicles with partial
        or circumferential loss of epithelium and replacement with
        histiocytes and lymphocytes.

-   ***Focal lymphocytic (nonspecific) thyroiditis***

    -   Common, 25-60% of autopsy studies

    -   Most common in older women

    -   Asymptomatic, often have low levels of antithyroid antibodies

    -   Macro: no significant gross findings

    -   LM:

        -   aggregates of lymphocytes between follicles.

        -   no significant follicle damage or destruction

        -   Oncocytic change rare.

        -   Follicular atrophy rare.

-   ***Painless/silent/subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis***

    -   Painless, minimally and diffusely enlarged gland.

    -   Present with transient mild hyperthyroidism, followed by period
        of hypothyroidism that spontaneously resolves.

    -   Middle age females, especially postpartum (***postpartum
        thyroiditis***)

    -   Unknown aetiology. ?autoimmune

    -   Symptoms develop over 1-2 weeks, last 2-8 weeks.

    -   LM:

        -   lymphocytic infiltration with hyperplastic germinal centres.

        -   Patchy disruption and collapse of thyroid follicles.

        -   Fibrosis and Hurtle cell metaplasia are not
            prominent features.

-   ***Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis)***

    -   Autoimmune disease.

    -   Presence of anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidise Ab.

    -   F:M = 10:1. 45-65 yrs.

    -   May coexist with other autoimmune diseases

    -   Painless diffuse goitre. initially with thyrotoxicosis, followed
        by hypothyroidism.

    -   Macro: diffusely enlarged thyroid, firm with mildly
        nodular surface. Lobulation on cut surface, may appear
        tan-yellow due to fibrosis.

    -   LM:

        -   Diffuse but variable intensity lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate
            with abundant germinal follicles.

        -   Effacement of follicles. Lymphoepithelial lesions.

        -   Atrophic and small follicles. Dense or absent colloid.

        -   Hurtle cell change

        -   increased interstitial connective tissue.

        -   Variant: ***fibrosing variant of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis***

    -   DDx: Lymphoma, Riedel’s thyroiditis

    -   FNA: Presence of Hurtle cells with heterogenous lymphocyte
        population is characteristic on FNA.

    -   Increased risk of primary thyroid lymphoma – DLBCL or MALToma

-   ***Riedel’s thyroiditis (invasive fibrous thyroiditis)***

    -   Fibrosing disease, associated with fibrosing disease at other
        sites such as the mediastinum, retroperitoneum and lung. IgG4
        related

    -   Rare

    -   women, 5^th^ decade

    -   unknown aetiology

    -   Characterised by extensive fibrosis involving thyroid and
        contiguous neck structures

    -   Present with firm thyroid enlargement, dysphagia,
        stridor, dyspnoea. Most euthyroid at presentation but may
        become hypothyroid.

    -   Macro: Often received in pieces. Tan-white, firm with
        attached muscle.

    -   LM:

        -   Effacement of parenchyma

        -   dense, hypocellular eosinophilic fibrous tissue. fibrosis
            extends into surrounding soft tissue.

        -   Scattered and patchy aggregates of lymphocytes, plasma
            cells, neutrophils and eosinophils. No germinal centres
            or granulomas.

        -   Rare, entrapped and atrophic follicles.

        -   Characteristic small veins with myxoid intimal thickening
            and infiltrating lymphocytes (occlusive phlebitis)

-   ***Graves disease (diffuse toxic goitre)***

    -   Autoimmune. TSH-R stimulating antibodies

    -   F:M = 10:1. 20-40yrs old

    -   Presents with diffuse goitre, hyperthyroidism, ophthalmopathy
        and proptosis

    -   Macro:

        -   Diffusely and symmetrically enlarged

        -   Hyperaemic, oedematous

        -   Gland may be nodular or fibrotic after long-standing disease
            or post-treatment

    -   LM:

        -   low power lobular accentuation due to increased septal
            fibrous tissue

        -   Inflammation varies from none, to patchy lymphocytic, to
            lymphocytic with formation of germinal centres.

        -   Diffuse follicular hyperplasia

            -   Small, colloid depleted follicles.

            -   Scalloped colloid margins

            -   follicular epithelium is tall, crowded, irregular and
                convoluted

            -   small papillae (lack fibrovascular cores) which project
                into lumen and encroach on colloid.

        -   Glands treated with radioactive iodine show initially
            nuclear abnormalities, dissolution of some of the follicles,
            and vascular alterations.
