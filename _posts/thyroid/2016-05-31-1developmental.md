-   ***Pyramidal lobe***

-   ***Thyroglossal duct cyst***

    -   Midline cyst

    -   LM:

        -   lined by flattened, respiratory type or squamous epithelium.

        -   Cysta may have thyroid tissue within wall.

-   ***Heterotopic thyroid***

    -   ***Lingual thyroid***

        -   Normal thyroid tissue present at base of tongue.

-   ***Branchial cleft/pouch anomalies***

    -   patent fistula, a simple sinus, a blind cyst, or an island of
        cartilage

    -   2^nd^ branchial pouch: anterior to sternocleidomastoid muscle in
        midneck, may communicate with pharynx

    -   LM:

        -   Lined by squamous, columnar or ciliated epithelium

        -   Abundant lymphoid tissue, often with germinal centers, is
            observed beneath.

        -   contain keratinaceous material

    -   DDx: cystic SCC metastasis to LN

-   ***Solid cell rest/s***

    -   Remnant of ultimobranchial body, derived from branchial cleft
        pouch complex IV–V

    -   measure 0.1 mm on average

    -   LM:

        -   mainly composed of polygonal or oval cells admixed with
            occasional clear cells. Small glandular lumina containing a
            mucinous secretion are often present.

        -   substantial number of C cells may be seen around the nests

    -   IHC: High and low MWCK, CEA, p63.
