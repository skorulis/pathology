-   Impaired synthesis of thyroid hormone causes compensatory increase
    in TSH and resultant hypertrophy/hyperplasia of thyroid follicular
    cells, and ultimately enlargement of entire gland.

-   follicles often filled with colloid ‘colloid goitre’

-   Occurs as endemic and sporadic

    -   Endemic – iodine deficiency

    -   Sporadic – goitrogens (substances interfere with TH synthesis),
        inherited defects in TH synthesis.

-   2 phases

    -   hyperplastic phase – diffusely enlarged gland. Follicles lined
        by crowded columnar cells which may pile up and
        form projections. Accumulation not uniform – some follicles
        hugely distended, others remain small.

    -   phase of colloid involution – if increased dietary iodine
        increases or demand for TH reduces, the stimulated follicular
        epithelium involutes to form an enlarged colloid rich gland
        (colloid goitre).
